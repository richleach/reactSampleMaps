# reactSampleMaps
A sample React app with auth to store user's houses on a map using Google Maps

I think the origin of this app was from an online training class for React/GraphQL and Google maps; when I remember or when I find a link I'll be sure to post it here to give full credit. Anyway a realtor client of mine was looking for this same functionality so I pieced this together as a proof of concept.
